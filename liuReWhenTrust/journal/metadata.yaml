abstract: "To design an effective model-based algorithm avoiding lower asymptotic performance due to error in model approximation, Janner, M. et al. studies the role of model usage in policy optimization and introduces an algorithm called model-based policy optimization (MBPO). The algorithm makes limited use of a predictive model to achieve pronounced improvements in performance. In this reproducibility challenge, the work mainly focuses on the replication of MBPO algorithm, the re-implementation of predictive model. Our experiments results matched graphs from the original paper which confirms the supremacy of the MBPO algorithm. We also open source the code for generating the results and setting up the experiments."
