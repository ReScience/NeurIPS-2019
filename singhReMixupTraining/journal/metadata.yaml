abstract: "Miscalibration of a model is defined as the mismatch between predicting probability 
          estimates and the true correctness likelihood. In this work, we aim to replicate 
          the results reported by \\cite{onmixup} on their analysis of the effect of Mixup
          \\cite{mixup_2018} on a network's calibration. Mixup is an effective yet 
          simple approach of data augmentation, which generates a convex combination of a 
          pair of training images and their corresponding labels as the input and 
          target for training a network. We replicate the results reported by the
           authors for CIFAR-100 \\cite{cifar100}, Fashion-MNIST \\cite{fmnist}, 
           STL-10 \\cite{stl10}, out-of-distribution and random noise data. 
           Our implementation code can be found at \\url{https://github.com/MacroMayhem/OnMixup}"
