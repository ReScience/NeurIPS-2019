abstract: "The Third Editon of Reproducibility Challenge, conducted at NeurIPS 2019 and part of its official program of reproducibility, is an open, peer-reviewed, collaborative experiment in evaluating Replicability and Reproducibility of Machine Learning articles accepted at NeurIPS 2019. We conduct the challenge through Fall 2019 on accepted papers in this conference, and in this special issue of ReScience journal we present the peer-reviewed selected reports."
