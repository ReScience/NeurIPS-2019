abstract: "In this work, we reproduce what we believe are the most important results presented in the Tensor Monte Carlo paper (Aitchison [2019]),
           where we also provide our reimplementation code. The original results in the TMC paper were attained via a PyTorch (Paszke et al. [2017]) implementation.
           In an attempt to ease understanding for those unfamiliar with PyTorch, we contribute with a TensorFlow (Abadi et al. [2015]) implementation.
           Additionally, as we found the TMC architecture non-trivial to understand, we aim to ease understanding for future users by complementing the textual description of the model with an algorithmic description and a depiction of the model."
