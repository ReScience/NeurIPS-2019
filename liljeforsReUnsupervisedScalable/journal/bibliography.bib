abstract="Several alternative distance measures for comparing time series have recently been proposed and evaluated on time series classification (TSC) problems. These include variants of dynamic time warping (DTW), such as weighted and derivative DTW, and edit distance-based measures, including longest common subsequence, edit distance with real penalty, time warp with edit, and move--split--merge. These measures have the common characteristic that they operate in the time domain and compensate for potential localised misalignment through some elastic adjustment. Our aim is to experimentally test two hypotheses related to these distance measures. Firstly, we test whether there is any significant difference in accuracy for TSC problems between nearest neighbour classifiers using these distance measures. Secondly, we test whether combining these elastic distance measures through simple ensemble schemes gives significantly better accuracy. We test these hypotheses by carrying out one of the largest experimental studies ever conducted into time series classification. Our first key finding is that there is no significant difference between the elastic distance measures in terms of classification accuracy on our data sets. Our second finding, and the major contribution of this work, is to define an ensemble classifier that significantly outperforms the individual classifiers. We also demonstrate that the ensemble is more accurate than approaches not based in the time domain. Nearly all TSC papers in the data mining literature cite DTW (with warping window set through cross validation) as the benchmark for comparison. We believe that our ensemble is the first ever classifier to significantly outperform DTW and as such raises the bar for future work in this area.",

  abstract = {In recent years, significant progress has been made in solving challenging
problems across various domains using deep reinforcement learning (RL).
Reproducing existing work and accurately judging the improvements offered by
novel methods is vital to sustaining this progress. Unfortunately, reproducing
results for state-of-the-art deep RL methods is seldom straightforward. In
particular, non-determinism in standard benchmark environments, combined with
variance intrinsic to the methods, can make reported results tough to
interpret. Without significance metrics and tighter standardization of
experimental reporting, it is difficult to determine whether improvements over
the prior state-of-the-art are meaningful. In this paper, we investigate
challenges posed by reproducibility, proper experimental techniques, and
reporting procedures. We illustrate the variability in reported metrics and
results when comparing against common baselines and suggest guidelines to make
future results in deep RL more reproducible. We aim to spur discussion about
how to ensure continued progress in the field by minimizing wasted effort
stemming from results that are non-reproducible and easily misinterpreted.},
