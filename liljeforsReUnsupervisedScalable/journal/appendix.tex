In this section, we present the full results of our experiments on the UCR and UEA Archives.

\section{UEA Archive Results}
The following is our full results on the 30 UEA datasets. Note that we were not able to reproduce the SVM results for the InsectWingbeat dataset since it has a very large number of samples (30,000 training and 20,000 test samples), and we could not manage to train the SVM on it in a timely manner (training the SVM was taking more than a day using the scikit-learn library.)
